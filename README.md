# How to Use (Download and Run)
Step 1: Download the Application

The application is distributed as an Electron package for Windows and does not require installation.

    Go to the [Releases] section on GitHub. (Replace this link with your actual releases page.)

    Download the latest package (e.g., Falcon.BMS.logbook.editor.rar).

Step 2: Run

    Unzip the downloaded folder (e.g., Falcon.BMS.logbook.editor.rar).

    Run the executable file inside the folder (e.g., falcon-bms-logbook-editor.exe).

Step 3: Edit the Logbook

    Open File: Click the "Load .lbk File" button and navigate to your .lbk file (Falcon BMS 4.38\User\Config\___.lbk).

    Edit Data: Modify the statistical and text fields, such as you want.

    Save: Click "Save .lbk File". The editor will overwrite the existing file (or prompt for a new location if you loaded a backup).
